Before Optimization
System function OutputDebugStringA() used by GStar::ConsolePrint() takes 40% samples
GStar::Vector3::Dot() takes most exclusive samples 5.16% amount functions writen by me
GStar::Vector3::Cross() takes 1.35% samples
After Optimization
System function OutputDebugStringA() used by GStar::ConsolePrint() takes 44% samples
GStar::Vector3::Dot() takes most exclusive samples 6.53% amount functions writen by me
GStar::Vector3::Cross() takes 0.55% samples

Other ways of optimization pick up the first two collision that would use least time 
to happen then only test those objects whose movement have been changed in the last collision
with other objects.Compare their potential collision time with privous calculated time 
to find the next collision. It would be less caluculation for every two collision detections.
