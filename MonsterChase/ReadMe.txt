Assignment2.10
Check the SDot and SCross in the Vector3 class for SSE implmentation, Chech Matrix4.h for SSE Version of matrix multiplication. 
Check CollisionTest.hpp and CollisionTest.cpp for Unite Test, check Results.txt for Sampleing results before and after using SSE.  
#Extra Assignment2
Check Delegate.h EventSystem.h EventManager.h EventUnit.h KeyInputEvent.h for implementations, it is used to get the imputs from the keyboard and mouse.
#Extra Assignment1
Check MyString class for Rvalue reference implementaion. MyString class is used everywhere in the project.
#Assignment 2.08
CollisionManager.cpp and CollisionManager.h for implementation, Use F T G H to move around Change Physicscomponent on trans3 and trans4 to change the mass of objects.
#Assignment 2.07
Check CollisionComponent.h, CollisionComponent.cpp for 3d collision implmentation. Use "F T G H" to move around.
#Assignment 2.06
Check Matrix4 for 4*4 matrix implementation, the Vector4 is generated during the calculation using Vector3
#Assignment 2.05
The data is in the Sprite.lua file, used Manager.h and Manager.cpp to read the camera info from the file and generate the camera in the TestScene.h File.
#Assignment 2.04 
The Oberserving is under GStar, in SmartPointer Filter, Named ObservingPointer, Used in Sphere class and hit_rec class. 
Notice the generation process will take a while, the generation progress is printed at Output console.
#Assignment 2.03 
The SmartPointer is under GStar, in SharedPointer Filter, Named SharedPointer, Used in Sphere class and hit_rec class. 
Notice the generation process will take a while.
#Assignment 2.02 
The Timer is in the Time Filter, Named GSTime
The Physic implimentation is in the Physics Filter, Named PhysicComponent. The PhysicManager manages the PhysicComponents The physicbasedController
Controls the object under physics. use "T""F"G""H" to move the object and use mouse to rotate the object.
